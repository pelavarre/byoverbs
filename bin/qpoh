#
# our CLI to create/ destroy Git Branches
# should feel as familiar and simple as
# our mkdir/ shdir CLI to create/ destroy folders of files
#

#
# these five notes will take you there
#


#### the CLI Life Cycle of a Git Branch ####


# 1 - Pick out what Branches people made before you

ssh host0
git branch --all |less -FIRX
git branch --all |grep /feature/ |grep -v /guests/


# 2 - Make your Branch remotely, like 'mkdir',
# only once, at only one Clone inside one Host

ssh host1
git push origin HEAD:guests/jqdoe  # create remote for: git branch


# 3 - Copy your Branch out to each Host,
# everywhere all at once, distributed consistency

ssh host1, ssh host2, etc
git fetch --prune --prune-tags --force
git checkout guests/jqdoe


# 3.5 - Alternatively, make your Branch local first, then push, then distribute

ssh host1
git checkout -b guests/jqdoe/goodwork-PROJ-12345
git push --set-upstream origin guests/jqdoe/goodwork-PROJ-12345  # create remote for: git branch


# 4 - Delete your Branch remotely, like 'rm -rf',
# only once, at only one Clone inside one Host

cat .git/config
ssh host3
git push origin --delete guests/jqdoe  # delete for: git branch


# 5 - Delete your Branch locally from each Host,
# everywhere all at once, distributed consistency

ssh host4
git checkout -
git branch -D guests/jqdoe
