# bugs/Readme.md

You should feel agency and power, when you work with your thing.
You should feel you can change it.
You should feel we've invited you to improve it.
But a bug is a thing only when it bothers someone who matters.

How can we get you to feel you matter too,
while you're working for hire inside a Terminal Sh?

Step 1:
Show you're not alone, by posting these Docs for the Bugs that annoy you too.

Step 2:
Add working Python Verbs alongside the broken Sh Verbs.

Step 3:
Grow and debug the Python Verbs, till we don't need the broken Sh Verbs any more.

We'll know we've got this working when you first report a Bug to us.
