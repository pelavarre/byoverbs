# bugs/Readme.md

A bug is a thing that bothers someone who matters.

You should feel agency and power, when you work with your thing.
You should feel you can change it.
You should feel we've invited you to improve it.

How now do we get you to feel you matter too,
even while you're working inside a Terminal Sh?

Step 1:
Show you're not alone, by posting these Docs for the Bugs that annoy you too.

Step 2:
Add working Python Verbs alongside the broken Sh Verbs.

Step 3:
Grow and debug the Python Verbs, till we don't need the broken Sh Verbs any more.
