## Welcome

Welcome to our game

You open one Terminal Window at right, and
you tell it to invite Turtles to move around and draw on it

    python3 bin/turtling.py --yolo

You open another Terminal Window at left, and
you tell it to invite you to type Logo Turtle Instructions into it

    python3 bin/turtling.py -i

We take the Logo Turtle Instructions you type into the left Window,
auto-complete them to form Python,
and run the Python in the right Window,
to tell the Turtle how to move and what to draw

This text walks you through tests of Logo Turtles

You can try these same tests on other Logo Turtles found elsewhere.
In particular, adding Python into macOS lets you try

    python3 -i -c ''

    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.forward(100)


## Move the Turtle

Try

    fd

We guess you meant 't.forward(100)', so we type that out for you.
You can type 'forward' to mean the same thing.
You can even type out the full Python yourself if you want:

    import turtling
    t = turtling.Turtle()
    t.forward(100)



## Help us please

You know you've got thoughts.
Please do speak them out loud as words
