Let's compare Emacs, Vim, macOS Notes, Msft VsCode, and Pq

Vim gives you their ⎋ Meta Mode, the rest don't.
Vim launches in ⎋ Meta Mode, the rest launch in Insert Mode.
Pq launches in Replace Mode

Vim doesn't give you ⌃A ⌃B ⌃D ⌃E ⌃F ⌃K ⌃N ⌃O ⌃P ⌥← ⌥→ in Replace/ Insert Mode

Emacs inside your Shell Input Rows doesn't give you the ⎋Z "zap-to-char".
Vim gives it to you as as ⌃O D F.
Pq gives it to your Emacs brain as ⎋Z and to your Vim Brain as ⌃Q ⌃O D F

Vim often makes you wait when you press Esc to switch into Meta Mode.
That Vim will let ⌃C cancel the wait,
but only if you give up asking for multiple copies of your input

Only Pq

1 ) Gives more respect to the Keys you learned at Emacs or Vim,
without forcing you to speak only the one dialect or the other

2 ) Shows you what Key Caps you pressed that it didn't understand

3 ) Nearly always holds back from shocking you with a loud audible beep

4 ) Runs well inside your Shell Input Rows,
or whatever part of your Terminal Screen you give it,
without needing to take over your whole Terminal Screen

5 ) Edits Screen Rows & Columns after you print them, even though it didn't print them

6 ) Let's you drag & drop Folders of Folders of Files to reconfigure it

7 ) Lets you write Python to reconfigure it

Nobody talks clearly of these ideas.
Most Vim Docs speak of its ⎋ Meta Mode as "Normal Mode" or "Control Mode".
Striking the D F Key Caps in ⎋ Meta Mode
work differently than striking ⇧D ⇧F Key Caps there,
and work differently from striking ⌃D and ⌥D and ⌘D too
