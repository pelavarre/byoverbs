Let's compare Emacs, Vim, macOS Notes, Msft VsCode, and Pq

1 ) Vim gives you their ⎋ Meta Mode, the rest don't.
Vim launches in ⎋ Meta Mode, the rest launch in Insert Mode.
Pq launches in Replace Mode

2 ) Vim doesn't give you ⌃A ⌃B ⌃D ⌃E ⌃F ⌃K ⌃N ⌃O ⌃P ⌥← ⌥→ in Replace/ Insert Mode.
macOS & VsCode do in fact give you all of these, copied from Emacs,
but too many people never test these

3 ) Emacs inside your Shell Input Rows doesn't give you the ⎋Z "zap-to-char".
Vim gives it to you as as ⌃O D F.
Pq gives it to your Emacs brain as ⎋Z and to your Vim Brain as ⌃Q ⌃O D F

4 ) Vim often makes you wait when you press Esc to switch into Meta Mode.
The Vim's of that kind will let ⌃C cancel the wait,
but only if you give up asking for multiple copies of your input

5 ) Only Pq

5.1 ) Gives more respect to the Keys you learned at Emacs or Vim,
without forcing you to speak only the one dialect or the other

5.2 ) Shows you what Key Caps you pressed that it didn't understand

5.3 ) Nearly always holds back from shocking you with a loud audible beep

5.4 ) Runs well inside your Shell Input Rows,
or whatever part of your Terminal Screen you give it,
without needing to take over your whole Terminal Screen

5.5 ) Edits Screen Rows & Columns after you print them, even though it didn't print them

5.6 ) Let's you drag & drop Folders of Folders of Files to reconfigure it

5.7 ) Lets you write Python to reconfigure it

Nobody talks clearly of these ideas.
Most Vim Docs speak of its ⎋ Meta Mode as "Normal Mode" or "Control Mode".
Striking the D F Key Caps in ⎋ Meta Mode
work differently than striking the ⇧D ⇧F Key Caps there,
and work differently from striking the ⌃D and ⌥D and ⌘D Key Caps too
