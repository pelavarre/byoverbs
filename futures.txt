try loud insert mode that expires at arrows, when not fed, etc
pattern of search-replace that keeps lit the searches and the replaces
syntax coloring without corrupting spaces past end-of-line
history of what was replaced, what was deleted
edit as bookmark, reached by Undo


bin/git.py
wrong accident redefine Origin where? how about: git push origin HEAD:origin/feature/foo
git log --no-decorate --pretty=format:'%h%x09%an%x09%cd%x20%x09%s' --author=plavarre |grep May |grep '2021 -'

vim
solve evolving Vim vs:  :set listchars=tab:\\·,trail:·

    :nnoremap <space><space> :b <C-d>
    :nnoremap <BS> :b#<CR>
    :nnoremap <S-Tab> :bprevious<CR>
    :nnoremap <Tab> :bnext<CR>


bin/

test venv:  rm -fr sandbox9/ && python3 -m venv --prompt SBOX9 sandbox9 && source sandbox9/bin/activate

the version is y.m.d till it needs to be something else?

dd some large file, to keep it easy to raise free space quickly

~ dreams of sharing Sh Terminal space more fairly ~
# diff -urp <(echo $LESSOPEN) <(echo '| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s')
#

cp.py with 1 arg

loop for more input inside:  open.py --
strip trailing slash

whoa wrong to promise no screen
$ screen.bash
++ screen -r 1 Socket in /run/screen/S-plavarre
There is no screen to be resumed matching 1.
$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
	2615111.pts-0.dev-plavarre3	(11/09/2022 06:18:56 PM)	(Detached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-plavarre.
$ screen.bash 1

... |t -50

insert separators more smoothly than
% cv |g : |gv '0:00:0[0123]' |g http |column -t |(sleep 0.1 && awk 'BEGIN{print ""} {o=d; h=0+substr($4, 1, 2); d=(h >= 6) && (h < 18)} (o != d){print ""} {print}' && echo)

explain bin/screen.bash

add whence.py to default to whence -a including Aliases & Funcs of Bash & Zsh

grow bin/a to take separator and index as arg
    not only always default to no explicit separator and the NF kind of NF+1-1 index

erase Mac v Linux
@ find.py .
@ tac.py, tail.py -r, tail.py +3
@ ls.py --full-time
but with --ext=.py to show the source

Emacs too, not just Vim

d for diff -brpu a b

mv.py arg - mv -i with 'git config user.initials' and date-time last modified
cp.py arg - cp -ipR with 'git config user.initials' and date-time last modified

make pwnyou - for pushing out diff's
